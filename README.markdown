# ShareThat : upload & share, directly 

A straightforward sharing platform, with efficient upload and publish functionality. Also my first real Rails web application. I had the idear of this after having a look to [David Darts's PirateBox](http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox_DIY). In case of an "intranet", we don't need much technical sophistication.
